# Canvas Engine

i dont have a good name for this yet so this is it for now

A VERY simple game engine written for HTML Canvas.
Mostly just wrote this cause i wanted to add a start screen to my Pong game, but i turned it into a little bit more than that.
I am planning on expanding this with some more expected game engine features, but no clue when i'll do that.

Current features:

- Simple input manager
- Simple audio manager
- Simple scene manager
- Render loop with references to the canvas and rendering context for drawing.
- Update loop with references to all the managers, and delta time.
